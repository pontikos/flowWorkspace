Title: Import flowJo Workspaces into BioConductor and replicate flowJo gating

Description: This package is designed to facilitate comparison of automated
    gating methods against manual gating done in flowJo. This package allows
    you to import basic flowJo workspaces into BioConductor and replicate the
    gating from flowJo using the flowCore functionality. Gating hierarchies,
    groups of samples, compensation, and transformation are performed so that
    the output matches the flowJo analysis.
